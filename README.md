## Scripts
### plot.R
Parallels were drawn between Meningioma tumor subtypes and mouse embryonic single-cell RNA-Seq dataset. 
This method determined developmental cell types enriched in each meningioma subtype.  
Single-cell RNASeq data from many developmental stages in mouse embryos were collected from the Shendure Lab at the University of Washington (Cao et al., 2023)

### seurat_fbw7.Rmd
